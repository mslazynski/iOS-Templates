# iOS-Templates
Repository with custom made iOS File templates

## HOW-TO 

Just put the templates into: ''~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File Templates''

### Protocol Based Objects

This Objective-C template creates a protocol with a corresponding default "proxy" implementation. Very useful in cases you want to use Protocol Oriented Programming in Obj-C.

### Enum Class

This Objective-C template creates a enum with a corresponding class, which can translate enum values to their string representation (and vice versa). Thanks to second-orded macros the list of item has to be changed only once.
